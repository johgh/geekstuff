I - I wish you could swim
         D                            G
Like the dolphins - like dolphins can swim
       C                                D
Though nothing - nothing will keep us together
       Am       Em           D
We can beat them forever and ever
             C     G             D
Oh we can be Heroes just for one day

D             G 
I - I will be King
    D                 G
And you - you will be Queen
    C                        D
For nothing will drive them away
          C      G              D
We can be Heroes - just for one day
          Am      Em            D
We can be honest - just for one day

D           G
I - I can remember (I remember)
D               G
Standing by the wall (By the wall)
        D            G
And the guards shot above our heads (Over our heads)
       D                              G
And we kissed as though nothing would fall (Nothing could fall)

        C                D
And the shame was on the other side
          Am           Em       D
Oh we can beat them forever and ever
               C      G            D
Then we can be Heroes just for one day

D  G  D  G 

D         G      D
We can be Heroes
          G      D
We can be Heroes
          G                   D
We can be Heroes just for one day
          G
We can be Heroes
