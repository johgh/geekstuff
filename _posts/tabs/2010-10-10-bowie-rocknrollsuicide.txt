              C                          E7
Time takes a cigarette  puts it in your mouth
                  F                    G                 Am
You pull on your finger, then another finger, then your cigarette
G                      F           G                   Am
  The wall to wall is calling  it lingers, then you forget
G    F
Oh  you're a rock'n roll suicide
C  G                    C                     E7
     You're too old to lose it  too young to choose it
         F              G                 Am
And the clock waits so patiently on your song
G                  F                 G                       Am
  You walk past a cafe but you don't eat when you lived too long
G        F
Oh no no no you're a rock'n roll suicide
C  G                                            E7
     Chev brakes are snarling  as you stumble across the road
        F             G                  Am
But the day breaks instead so you hurry home
G                F              G
  Don't let the sun blast your shadow
               E7                    Am
don't let the milk floats ride your mind                 EADGBE
    F         D9          G7                       (D9 = xx4210)
So natural religiously unkind
                       C
Oh no love you're not alone
                                     A
You're watching yourself but you're too unfair
              C                                    A
you got your head all tangled but if I could only make you care
   C#m                  G#m
Oh no love you're not alone
           B                  D#m
no matter what or who you've been
          Bbm                   C#
no matter when or where you've seen
         B                       D#m
all the knives to lacerate your brain
             Bbm                           C#
I've had my share  I'll help you with the pain  you're not alone
Bb              C#
                 Just turn on me  you're
Bb                  C#
not alone          let's turn on me and be
you're not alone   gimme your hands
you're wonderful   gimme your hands
you're wonderful   gimme your hands

  Bb   Fm   Cm   F#   C#
