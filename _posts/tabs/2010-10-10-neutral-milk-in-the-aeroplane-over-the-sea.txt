chorus: G Em C D

G                 Em
What a beautiful face 
                       C
i have found in this place
                  D 
that is circling all around the sun. 
G                  Em
What a beautiful dream
                          C
that could flash on the screen 
                  D                    G
in a blink of an eye and be gone from me
      Em 
soft and sweet
         C                 D                G Em C D
let me hold it close and keep it here with me



and one day we will die
and our ashes will fly from the aeroplane over the sea
but for now we are young
let us lay in the sun
and count every beautiful thing we can see
Love to be 
in the arms of all i'm keepin here with me


what a curious life we have found here tonight
there is music that sounds from the street
there are lights in the cloud
*Anna's ghost all around 
hear her voice as it's rolling and ringing through me
soft and sweet
How the notes all bend and reach above the trees

Bridge: Em C G D
Em                   C
now how i remember you
                                  G
how i would push my fingers through
                                    D
your mouth to make those muscles move
                                       Em
that make your voice so smooth and sweet
                                  C
And now we keep where we don't know 
                                  G
All secrets sleep in winter clothes
                             D
with one you loved so long ago

now he don't even know his name


Chorus: G Em C D

What a beautiful face 
i have found in this place
that is circling all round the sun
and when we meet on a cloud 
I'll be laughing out loud 
I'll be laughing with everyone i see
Can't believe how strange it is to be anything at all
