G      C       G          C
Sunday mornin' brings the dawn in
G  G/F#        Em               A7    D
   It's just a restless feelin' by my side

G     C        G      C
Early dawnin', Sunday mornin'
G  G/F#          Em              A7      D
   It's just the wasted years so close behind

G              C
Watch out, the world's behind you
G                  C
There's always someone around you
         Am                    F   D
Who will call, it's nothing at all

G      C        G       C
Sunday mornin', and I'm fallin'
G  G/F#       Em              A7      D
   I've got a feelin' I don't want to know

G     C        G      C
Early dawnin', Sunday mornin'
G  G/F#         Em                         A7    D
   It's all the streets you crossed not so long ago

G              C
Watch out, the world's behind you
G                  C
There's always someone around you
         Am                    F   D
Who will call, it's nothing at all

G C G C 
G G/F# Em A7 D

G              C
Watch out, the world's behind you
G                  C
There's always someone around you
         Am                    F   D
Who will call, it's nothing at all
