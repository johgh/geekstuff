D         C   G    D       
I see the bad moon rising,
D     C       G      D
I see trouble on the way
D     C    G          D          
I see earthquakes and lightning,
D     C   G     D
I see bad times today.


Chorus:
G                                   
Don't go around tonight,  
D
Well it's bound to take your life
C         G               D
There's a bad moon on the rise
D      C    G     D         
I hear hurricanes blowing,
D          C      G      D
I know the end is coming soon
D      C      G   D         
I fear rivers overflowing,
D          C        G        D
I hear the voice of rage and ruin.


Chorus

D        C        G      D          
Hope you got your things together,  
D            C     G           D
Hope you are quite prepared to die
D          C            G     D         
Looks like we're in for nasty weather,
D          C     G      D
One eye is taken for an eye.


Chorus
