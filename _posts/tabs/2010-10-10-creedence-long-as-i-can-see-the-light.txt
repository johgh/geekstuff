A     E             A      *       F#m              A   E
Put a candle in the window,  but I feel I've got to move.
           A      E      D
Though I'm going, going, I'll be coming home soon,
A       E             A    A D E 
long as I can see the light.

A       E                 A     *            F#m              A    E
Pack my bag and let's get movin,   cause I'm bound to drift a while.
           A     E     D
Though I'm gone, gone, you don't have to worry long,
A       E             A    A D E  A
long as I can see the light.
