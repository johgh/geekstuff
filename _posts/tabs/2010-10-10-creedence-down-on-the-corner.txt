C                     G                 C     
Early in the evenin, just around supper time, over by the courthouse, 
        G               C    F                        C 
they're starting to unwind, four kids on the corner, trying to bring you 
                                  G               C   
up, Willy picks a tune out and he blows it on the harp.

Chorus:

F           C       G          C                     F            C    
Down on the corner, out in the street, Willy and the Poorboys are playin 
          G              C 
bring a nickel, tap your feet 

Verse 2:

C                               G                 C     
Rooster hits the washboard, and people just gotta smile, Blinky thumps the 
         G         C       F                              C       
bass and solos for awhile. Poor-boy twangs the rythym out on his Kalamazoo.
                                G              C         
And Willy goes into a dance and doubles on Kazoo.

Repeat Chorus

Verse 3:

C                      G             C                     
You don't need a penny just to hang around, but if you got a nickel won't 
     G             C     F                   C      
you lay your money down. Over in the corner, there's a happy noise, people 
                         G              C  
come from all around to watch the magic boy.

Repeat chorus and fade
