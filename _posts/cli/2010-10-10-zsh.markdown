# Installation
Install zsh and set as default shell
: ~~~bash
$ sudo apt-get install zsh
$ sudo chsh -s /bin/zsh
~~~

Install Oh My Zsh
: ~~~bash
$ cd $HOME
$ git clone git://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh.git ~/.oh-my-zsh
$ cp ~/.oh-my-zsh/templates/zshrc.zsh-template ~/.zshrc
~~~

# Customize Zsh
Customize zsh config in $HOME/.zshrc
: ~~~bash
# set bash as default shell for compatibility with shellscripts
export SHELL=/bin/bash
# add user bin directory to the path
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
# enable some oh-my-zsh plugins
plugins=(git github git-extras command-not-found vim-interaction history-substring-search cp history)
# custom aliases
openapp(){ nohup xdg-open $1 > /dev/null 2> /dev/null }; alias o=openapp
~~~

> See some alias to include [here](http://localhost:4000/bash%20commands/#tocAnchor-1-2)

Reload .zshrc
: ~~~bash
$ source ~/.zshrc
~~~

# Autopushd
Put this on your .zshrc file
: ~~~bash
# set cd as an alias to pushd (every visited directory is saved in a stack)
setopt autopushd
~~~

Change dir and save new specified dir in a stack of dirs
: ```cd DIR```

> if no dir specified cd goes to $HOME as usual

Go to last visited directory
: ```cd -```

> as a side effect this command swaps (in the stack) your current directory with the last one visited

Go to directory from stack specified by index
: ```cd -↹INDEX```

> as a side effect this command swaps your current directory with the one specified from the stack

> ```cd -↹↹``` provides autocompletion

Specify path including subpath from stacked dir
: ```cd ~-↹INDEX```

> ```cd ~-↹↹``` provides autocompletion

Deletes directory from stack
: ```popd -↹INDEX```

> ```popd -↹↹``` provides autocompletion

Clear all saved directories from stack
: ```dirs -c```

# Vi + Bash bindings

Put this on your .zshrc file
: ~~~bash
{% raw %}
# free <C-S> so we can use it in vim
stty -ixon -ixoff
# vi mappings
bindkey -v
# C-S instead of ESC to enter Vi normal mode
bindkey '^S' vi-cmd-mode
## some standard bash keys so we can use it with vim mappings enabled
# navigation
bindkey '^[b' backward-word
bindkey '^[f' forward-word
# delete from cursor to beginning of line
bindkey '^U' backward-kill-line
# delete from cursor to end of line
bindkey '^K' kill-line

# delete next word
bindkey '^[d' kill-word
# backspace
bindkey '^h' backward-delete-char
# uppercase word starting from cursor
bindkey '^[u' up-case-word
# we keep up-history and down-history bindings for the plugin history-substring-search
bindkey '^P' history-substring-search-up
bindkey '^N' history-substring-search-down
# go to beginning of line (^A is used by tmux)
bindkey '^B' beginning-of-line
# go to end of line
bindkey '^E' end-of-line
