[Verse 1: Pharrell]
E                      Bm          
Like the legend of the phoenix,
D                      F#m
All ends with beginnings, 
E                     Bm
What keeps the planet spinning, Aha.
D                      F#m
The force from the beginning

Your gift keeps on giving
E                     Bm
What is this I'm feeling?
D                      F#m
If you want to leave, I'm with it
