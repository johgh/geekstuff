INTRO

  When you were young
             C              Bb       F
You were the king of carrot flowers
                          C                    Bb     C
And how you built a tower tumbling through the trees
                          Bb                   F
In holy rattlesnakes that fell all around your feet

Bb, F, C, Bb

F                                       C            Bb        F
  And your mom would stick a fork right into daddy's shoulder
                                     C              Bb      C
And your dad would throw the garbage all across the floor
                               Bb                       F
As we would lay and learn what each other's bodies were for

Bb, F, C, Bb

F
  And this is the room 
         C                   Bb        F
One afternoon I knew I could love you
                         C              Bb    C
And from above you how I sank into your soul
                             Bb              F
Into that secret place where no one dares to go

Bb, F, C, Bb

F                                      C          Bb        F
  And your mom would drink until she was no longer speaking
                               C                 Bb   C
And dad would dream of all the different ways to die
                            Bb               F
Each one a little more than he could dare to try

Bb, F, C, Bb, F x4
