C             Bb                 F
After all the jacks are in their boxes
C                   Bb          F
And the clowns have all gone to bed
C                      Bb            F
You can hear happiness staggering on down the street
G         Bb         Eb E F
Footsteps dressed in red
G       Bb            Eb E F  Eb E F
And the wind whispers Mary


C          Bb       F
A broom is drearily sweeping
C                       Bb          F
Up the broken peices of yesterday's life
C           Bb       F
Somewhere a queen is weeping
G           Bb          Eb E F
Somewhere a king has no wife
G            Bb    Eb E F  Eb E F
And the wind cries Mary

C                       Bb     F
The traffic lights turn blue tomorrow
C                       Bb         F
And shine the emptyness down on my bed
C               Bb   F
The tiny island sags downstream
G                   Bb       Eb E F
Cause the life that lived is dead
G            Bb      Eb E F  Eb E F
And the wind screams Mary


C             Bb     F
Will the wind ever remember
C                Bb           F
The names it has blown in the past
C                        Bb           F
With its crutch, its old age, and its wisdom
G                         Bb     Eb E F
It whispers no, this will be the last
G            Bb    Eb E F  Eb E F  Eb E F  Eb E F
And the wind cries Mary
