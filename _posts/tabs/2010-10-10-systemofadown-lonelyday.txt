G#m     E           B       Eb
Such a lonely day, and its mine
G#m     E           B       Eb
The most loneliest day of my life 
G#m     E           B       Eb
such a lonely day, should be banned
G#m     E           B       Eb
Its a day that I cant stand 

chorus:
G#m     E           B       Eb
The most loneliest day of my life

the most loneliest day of my life 

verse 2:
G#m     E           B       Eb
such a lonely day, shouldn't exist 
G#m     E           B       Eb
its a day that i'll never miss 
G#m     E           B       Eb
such a lonely day, and its mine
G#m     E           B       Eb
the most loneliest day of my life

E          Eb  F#       G#
and if you go, I wanna go with you

and if you die, I wanna die with you 
E          Eb  F#       G#
take your hand and walk away

Its a day that I'm glad I survived
