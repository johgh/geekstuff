INTRO

C  G  C  G

VERSE 1

C                      G
So I wrote it all in a letter
C                      G
But I don't know if it came
F                      C
The nurse she likes my writing
F                    C
So she keeps it just like me
        Bb            F
So that it won't get away

CHORUS

C       F              C
I won't be denied this time
        F            C
'Fore I go out of my mind
                    Am
Over matters got my foot on the ladder
    F            G         Em   Am   F  G
And I'm climbing up to the moon
C  G

VERSE 2

C                         G
Got a sky that looks like heaven
C                            G
Got an earth that looks like shit
F                    C
It's getting hard to tell where
F
What I am ends
    C                   Bb   F
And what they're making me begins

CHORUS

BREAK

Em       Am
Saturday in the yard
F                 C
They'll bring you by
Em             Am
We'll lay down on the grass
          Bb                F  C  F  C  F  C  G  Am  F  G
And watch as the sky closes in

CHORUS

C       F              C
I won't be denied this time
        F            C
'Fore I go out of my mind
                    Am
Over matters got my foot on the ladder
    F            G         Em   Am   F  G
And I'm climbing up to the moon
         G         Em   Am  F  G
Climbing up to the moon

OUTRO

Em  Am  F  G (x3), end on C
