[VERSE 1]
           E                        C#m               G#  A
 With your feet in the air and your head on the ground
E    C#m            G#       A         
 Try this trick and spin it, yeah
E                  C#m
 Your head will collapse
            G#
But there's nothing in it 
           A
And you'll ask yourself


[CHORUS]
E            C#m 
 Where is my mind?
G#           A
 Where is my mind?  
     E       C#m   G#  A       
 Where is my mind?

E  C#m  G#  A 

 E   G#         A             Am        C#m   B
 Way out in the water, see it swimming.

[VERSE 2] - (E  C#m  G#  A) 
I was swimmin' in the Carribean
Animals were hiding behind the rock
Except the little fish
But they told me, he swears
Tryin' to talk to me, to me, to me

-CHORUS-
